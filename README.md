# Odin Landing Page

Here you'll find a landing page mock up for a fake restaurant named Enlightening Sandwiches. As the Odin Project continues to expand and be revised, this is one of the projects I completed that was not required before. It serves as a good refresher for basic styling with flexbox. This page is not mobile responsive, especially when it comes to image scaling.

Check it out [here](https://rgee258.github.io/odin-landing-page/).

This project is done following The Odin Project, which can
be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page).
